This is a HOW_TO_BUILD file for Anvil library v1.0 by AMD

Q: How do I use Anvil?
A:

At its core, Anvil is a library, which should be statically linked with applications.
This can be easily achieved by doing the following:

1. create a new "anvil" directory in your project's dependencies folder.
2. copy include/ and src/ directories there.
3. (not recommended) for an in-place build, simply run:

   cmake -G "Your IDE of choice" ..

   in that directory.


   (recommended) for an out-of-place build, create a "build" directory" and
                 issue the cmake command (as above) from there.

    For a list of IDEs supported by your cmake installation, simply run:

    cmake --help
