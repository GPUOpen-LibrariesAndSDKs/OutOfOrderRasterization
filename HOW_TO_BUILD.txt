This is a HOW_TO_BUILD file for Anvil library v1.0 by AMD
----

Q: How do I use Anvil?
A:

At its core, Anvil is a library, which should be statically linked with applications.
This can be easily achieved by doing the following:

1. create a new "anvil" directory in your project's dependencies folder.
2. copy include/ and src/ directories there.
3. (not recommended) for an in-place build, simply run:

   cmake -G "Your IDE of choice" ..

   in that directory.


   (recommended) for an out-of-place build, create a "build" directory" and
                 issue the cmake command (as above) from there.

    For a list of IDEs supported by your cmake installation, simply run:

    cmake --help

Q: How can I run any of the included examples?
A: Let us say you are interested in running the "OutOfOrderRasterization" example.
   To build it:

1. Go to the examples\OutOfOrderRasterization directory.
2. Create a "build" directory.
3. From there, issue:

cmake -G "Your IDE of choice" ..

4. In the "build" directory, a project/solution file, supported by your IDE,
   should have been created. Open it, build the project, and you should be good
   to run it.
