This is a HOW_TO_BUILD file for the OutOfOrderRasterization sample
----

1. Go to the OOO_Rasterization directory.
2. Create a "build" directory.
3. From there, issue:

cmake -G "Your IDE of choice" ..

4. In the "build" directory, a project/solution file, supported by your IDE,
   should have been created. Open it, build the project, and you should be good
   to run it.
